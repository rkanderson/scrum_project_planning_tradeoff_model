## The model specification

The time needed to complete the current "task" at period t.

$$ D_t = B(1-pu_t) $$


Usefulness of most recent plan at time t


$$ u_{t+1} = r u_t $$
$$ u_1 = 1 $$
and u_t is reset back to 1 when a new plan is created. Thus

$$ u_{\sigma+1}=1, u_{2\sigma+1}=1, ... $$




The amount of time needed to create a plan for a given scope (sigma). If the scope is 5, then the plan would apply for 5 periods, including the period it was created on.

$$ L = c \sigma + k $$
